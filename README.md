## This is the backend of a an app that will generator a readme for a user. 

It prompts the user for the name of their project, a description of their project, which type of license the user wishes to use for their project, installation info, usage info, testing info, and lastly it asks for contributors names, emails, and github accounts. 

This data is then pushed to a readme.me.
